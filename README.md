# Empath

## See the web through the eyes of others.

Empathy Browser simulates how people with different disabilities experience the web. It builds empathy and promotes inclusion. This web browser uses various technologies to simulate the mismatch between the diversity of human capabilities and the internet.

Websites and digital materials that are not designed with accessibility in-mind exclude a significant population of potential users. Empathy Browser allows professionals, such as web developers and designers, to experience their projects in ways that relate them to users with a different array of abilities.

By experiencing a simulation of common disabilities, Empathy Browser will help you promote true diversity in a digital world. It will change the way technology professionals think about inclusive design, thus transforming technology and positively impacting the world.
