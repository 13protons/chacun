# Empath

## See the web through the eyes of others.

Empath is a web browser that uses various technologies to simulate the mismatch between the diversity of human capabilities and the internet.

Empath allows web developers to experience their project the way someone else may experience it, by simulating common disabilities.

Our goal with Empath is to build empathy and promote inclusion. We want to change the way technology professionals think about inclusive design.
